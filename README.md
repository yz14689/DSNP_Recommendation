# Project Name: Recommendation
Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree - Recommendation for IBM

## Working Environment
In order to determine which articles to show to each user, it is suggested to be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform. 

However, I would develop this project on Jupyter Notebook/Python 3.6 on my own environment. The overall algorithm, procedure and outputs should be consistent.

## Data source
Two data tables to be used in this project, which were provided:
- user-item-interactions:  Data set containing which user interacted with which article.
- articles_community: Data set consists the details of the articles
 
## Python libraries used:
   python3
   python packages in the requirements.txt file: datetime, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib   

## Tasks:
### I. Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Before making recommendations of any kind, explore the data for the project. 

### II. Rank Based Recommendations
#### First find the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions.  

### III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
#### Look at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with.  

### IV. Content Based Recommendations (EXTRA - NOT REQUIRED)
#### Complete a content based recommendation system.

### V. Matrix Factorization
#### Finally, complete a machine learning approach to building recommendations.
